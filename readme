# how to use

At first, run docker to use rselenium 
```
$ docker run -d -p 4444:4444 selenium/standalone-chrome
```

Data scraping program crawler.R is coded in R.
To run this code I use Rscript
```
$ Rscript crawler.R
```


**Notes ** crantab time is not used now. loop and timer should be used alternatively.
To collect data automatically, cron will run the program.
Schedule is asigned in /etc/crontab
```
$ crontab -e
```
```
# m h  dom mon dow   command
0 0 * * * Rscript ~/Documents/shiny-apps/amaten/crawler.R
```


To collect data automatically, run a script having loop with timer
```
$ nohup Rscript crawler_looop.R &
```
